## Description
Human garbage has polluted all the habitats of our planet! It is your job to destroy all the trash elements in order to clean the different environments and save the little seal.

## Development
This game was developed with Unity and C# during the participation in the course Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D, given by GameDev.tv Team on Udemy. All assets, except image backgrounds, music, and sound effects, were developed by me. Music and sound effects were taken from OpenGameArt. Fonts were downloaded from DaFont.
